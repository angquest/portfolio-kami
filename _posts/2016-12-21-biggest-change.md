title: The Biggest challenge I've faced when learning to develop
---
Over the past two and a half months the biggest challange I've faced while learning to develop is, understanding the core concepts of array's and functions within JavaScript. As stated in other posts I have gone to other outside resources to try to gasp these concepts, to get several different explainations in hopes to having it just "click". Every time I watch a new explaination, I understand better and better, so think the click is coming, hopefully sooner than later.
