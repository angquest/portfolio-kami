title: My Experience with Bloc
---
My overall experience with Bloc has been ok so far. I have had some issues understanding the languages introduced in the first project. Some might attribute that to the online environment, however, this is not my first rodeo; I have taken several online classes as well as traditional brick and mortor classes and have not had an issue learning. Over some personal evaluation, I believe it's the lack of internal resources for visual learners, like myself.
