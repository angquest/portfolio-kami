title: My Goals as a Frontend Developer
---
I would say frontend developer is not a complete goal for me. It is, however, a goal to learn it as part of my all around knowledge, so I can eventually become a software engineer. Currently, my short term goal is to understand JavaScript, jQuery, and the DOM. I am having a hard time grasping the concepts of arrays and functions is JavaScript, which only trickles down to jQuery. Understanding the DOM, I think, will come in time. In order to reach this short term goal, I have purchased several books on the above issues and have gone to other online resources; such as, YouTube, Udemy and CodeSchool to name a few. I have found learning to code is definitely not an easy process, and I wish I had started my coding journey 15 years ago when I took my first Visual Basic class.
