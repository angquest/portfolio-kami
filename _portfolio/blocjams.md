## Summary

Bloc Jams is a replica site of spotify to help students of Bloc learn the fundamentals essential to web development. Langauages learned include, HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Bloc students were also introduce to the DOM while working on this project.

## Explanation

Bloc Jams was an assignment and was required for Bloc students to complete a part to invoke a "learn by doing" process.

## Problem

No specific problem, per se, only learning the programming process and completing checkpoints. 

## Solution

Again, not much of a solution, only learning the process.

## Results

Completed the project and the checkpoints.

> What does the ">" do?

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I wish Bloc had better resources within the the program to complete the project, without having to go to several outside sources for visual learners.
